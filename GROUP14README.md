**_Grading Level:_**
Same grade for all members: 100%

**_Differences:_**

For this release, we implemented all of the things we said we were going to in our alpha build (Login screen, connecting to Firebase and having a library with dummy data). The login is possible with email/password. The Facebook underlying authentication is set up but will be complete in the next release. We completed all of the milestones we set forth but also
were able to get the registration screen added (at least the rudimentary verion) and also the configuration screen, that even saves the preferences.


**_Special Instructions:_**

You can register with an email and password, and login with those details.
